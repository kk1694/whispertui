This file captures learnings and notes across Ralph Loop iterations.
Each Claude instance should read this at the start and append notes at the end.

## Learnings

### 2026-01-17: Step 1a - Project Init & XDG Paths

- Bun's `bun init` creates a working TypeScript setup quickly
- XDG Base Directory spec is straightforward: environment variables override defaults
- Bun's test runner (`bun test`) works well, supports describe/test/expect patterns
- The `ensureDir` helper with `{ recursive: true }` handles nested directory creation

---

## Current State

- Project status: Step 1a complete
- Last completed task: Step 1a - Project Init & XDG Paths
- Current blockers: None

---

## Notes for Next Iteration

- Next task: Step 1b - Config Schema & Loader
- Will need to install `@iarna/toml` and `zod` packages
- Config file should be created at `~/.config/whispertui/config.toml`
- The `config` command currently shows paths; Step 1b will make it show actual config values
