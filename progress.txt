# WhisperTUI Progress & Learnings

This file captures learnings and notes across Ralph Loop iterations.
Each Claude instance should read this at the start and append notes at the end.

## Learnings

### 2026-01-17: Step 1a - Project Init & XDG Paths

- Bun's `bun init` creates a working TypeScript setup quickly
- XDG Base Directory spec is straightforward: environment variables override defaults
- Bun's test runner (`bun test`) works well, supports describe/test/expect patterns
- The `ensureDir` helper with `{ recursive: true }` handles nested directory creation

### 2026-01-17: Step 1b - Config Schema & Loader

- Zod 4.x has breaking changes from Zod 3.x - `.default({})` on object schemas with inner defaults no longer works the same way
- Solution: Use a PartialConfigSchema with all optional fields, then deep merge with defaults
- The `@iarna/toml` package works well for TOML parsing
- Deep merge is needed for partial config objects to properly overlay onto defaults
- Test isolation with XDG paths: Set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to a temp directory, but ensure path structure matches what `getConfigPath()` expects

### 2026-01-17: Step 2a - State Machine

- Pure state machine with no I/O makes testing straightforward
- Used TypeScript discriminated unions for DaemonEvent type - provides good type safety
- InvalidTransitionError custom error class helps with debugging and programmatic error handling
- The `canTransition` method allows checking validity without throwing
- Event emitter pattern using Set<Listener> and returning unsubscribe function is clean
- Context object is immutable (getter returns copy) to prevent accidental mutations
- 34 unit tests covering all valid transitions, invalid transitions, error handling, context tracking, and event emitter

## Current State

- Project status: Step 2a complete
- Last completed task: Step 2a - State Machine
- Current blockers: None

## Notes for Next Iteration

- Next task: Step 2b - Unix Socket Server & IPC
- Need to create Unix socket server with JSON protocol
- Wire command handlers to state machine
- Implement commands: start, stop, status, shutdown
- Add PID file management and socket cleanup
- Add SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown
