## Learnings

### 2026-01-17: Step 1a - Project Init & XDG Paths

- Bun's `bun init` creates a working TypeScript setup quickly
- XDG Base Directory spec is straightforward: environment variables override defaults
- Bun's test runner (`bun test`) works well, supports describe/test/expect patterns
- The `ensureDir` helper with `{ recursive: true }` handles nested directory creation

### 2026-01-17: Step 1b - Config Schema & Loader

- Zod 4.x has breaking changes from Zod 3.x - `.default({})` on object schemas with inner defaults no longer works the same way
- Solution: Use a PartialConfigSchema with all optional fields, then deep merge with defaults
- The `@iarna/toml` package works well for TOML parsing
- Deep merge is needed for partial config objects to properly overlay onto defaults
- Test isolation with XDG paths: Set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to a temp directory, but ensure path structure matches what `getConfigPath()` expects

---

### 2026-01-17: Step 2a - State Machine

- Pure state machine with no I/O makes testing straightforward
- Used TypeScript discriminated unions for DaemonEvent type - provides good type safety
- InvalidTransitionError custom error class helps with debugging and programmatic error handling
- The `canTransition` method allows checking validity without throwing
- Event emitter pattern using Set<Listener> and returning unsubscribe function is clean
- Context object is immutable (getter returns copy) to prevent accidental mutations
- 34 unit tests covering all valid transitions, invalid transitions, error handling, context tracking, and event emitter

---

### 2026-01-17: Step 2b - Unix Socket Server & IPC

- Node.js `net` module works well for Unix sockets - use `createServer()` for server and `connect()` for client
- JSON newline-delimited protocol is simple and effective for IPC
- PID file management: Check if PID is running with `process.kill(pid, 0)` - returns without error if process exists
- Socket permissions: Use `chmodSync(socketPath, 0o600)` for owner read/write only
- Stale file cleanup must happen before binding to socket, otherwise EADDRINUSE
- TypeScript: Socket `data` event can receive `Buffer | string`, need to handle both types
- Signal handlers: Use `process.on("SIGTERM/SIGINT")` for graceful shutdown
- Server lifecycle: Important to clean up clients, socket file, and PID file on shutdown
- Test isolation: Use `XDG_STATE_HOME` env var pointing to temp directory with unique PID suffix
- 30 new tests covering socket server, JSON protocol, commands, PID management, and cleanup

### 2026-01-17: Step 3a - Socket Client

- Socket client uses `connect()` from `node:net` to connect to Unix socket
- Quick fail by checking socket file exists before attempting connection - saves time when daemon not running
- Custom error classes (DaemonNotRunningError, ConnectionTimeoutError) help with user-friendly error messages
- Socket error codes: ECONNREFUSED and ENOENT both indicate daemon not running
- Response buffering: Accumulate data chunks until newline found, then parse JSON
- Timeout handling with `setTimeout()` and cleanup function to avoid resource leaks
- Toggle command needs two round trips: status to check current state, then start or stop
- Test isolation: Same pattern as server tests - use XDG_STATE_HOME with temp directory
- Testing timeout: Create mock server that accepts connections but never responds
- 18 new tests covering client connection, command sending, error handling, and response formatting

### 2026-01-17: Step 3b - Daemon Auto-Start

- Spawn daemon using `spawn()` with `detached: true` and `stdio: ["ignore", "ignore", "ignore"]` for clean background process
- Added `DaemonStartError` custom error class for spawn/startup failures
- `isDaemonStarting()` check prevents race condition when multiple commands try to start daemon simultaneously
- `waitForDaemon()` polls with configurable timeout until daemon responds to ping
- `ensureDaemonRunning()` is the main entry point - returns boolean indicating if daemon was auto-started
- CLI commands now auto-start daemon transparently using `ensureDaemonRunning()` before sending commands
- TypeScript: Need to use `stdio: ["ignore", "ignore", "ignore"]` (array form) instead of `stdio: "ignore"` (string form) to avoid type errors with spawn
- TypeScript: Need to check `process.argv[1]` for undefined before using
- 8 new tests covering waitForDaemon, ensureDaemonRunning, spawnDaemon, and DaemonStartError

### 2026-01-17: Step 4 - Audio Recording

- Created `src/audio/recorder.ts` with `AudioRecorder` class wrapping parecord subprocess
- Custom error classes: `ParecordNotFoundError` (with install instructions for Arch/Ubuntu/Fedora), `RecordingError`
- parecord args: `--file-format=wav --rate=16000 --channels=1 --format=s16le` for 16kHz mono WAV
- Device selection: Use `--device=` arg when config device is not "default"
- Temp files stored in XDG cache directory (`~/.cache/whispertui/recording-<timestamp>.wav`)
- Recording timeout protection: `setTimeout()` auto-stops after max duration (default 5 minutes)
- Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM to parecord, with SIGKILL fallback after 2 seconds
- `abort()` method for canceling without saving (SIGKILL + file cleanup)
- File validation: Check file exists and has content after stop, reject empty files
- Integrated recording into `DaemonServer` - start/stop commands now trigger actual audio recording
- DaemonServerOptions pattern: Accept config to extract recording settings, or provide recordingConfig directly
- Duck-typing for backward compatibility: Check if argument has `state` and `send` to detect StateMachine vs options object
- `cleanupOldRecordings()` helper to prune old temp files from cache directory
- 26 new tests covering recorder lifecycle, error handling, config extraction, and cleanup

### 2026-01-17: Step 5 - Groq API Integration

- Created `src/transcription/groq.ts` with `GroqClient` class for Whisper transcription
- Custom error classes: `MissingApiKeyError`, `TranscriptionApiError`, `InvalidAudioError`
- API key handling: Check config `api_key_env` for env var name, then read from `process.env`
- Direct API key support: Can pass `apiKey` directly to bypass env var lookup
- Groq API uses multipart/form-data with `FormData` and `Blob` for file upload
- Model: `whisper-large-v3` with JSON response format
- Request timeout with `AbortController` and configurable timeout (default 60s)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for retryable errors (429, 5xx, network errors)
- Non-retryable errors: 401, 400 - fail immediately with descriptive messages
- Audio file validation: Check file exists, non-empty, at least 44 bytes (WAV header size)
- Integrated transcription into `DaemonServer.handleStop()` - transcribes after recording stops
- `extractTranscriptionConfig()` helper extracts config from app Config object
- Mocking fetch in Bun tests: Use `mock()` with cast `as unknown as typeof fetch` to satisfy TypeScript
- 30+ new tests covering client creation, API key handling, transcription, error handling, and retries

### 2026-01-17: Step 6a - Clipboard Output

- Created `src/output/clipboard.ts` with `copyToClipboard()` function using wl-copy
- Custom error classes: `WlCopyNotFoundError` (with install instructions for Arch/Ubuntu/Fedora), `ClipboardError`
- wl-copy reads from stdin - write text to process.stdin then close
- Empty text is handled gracefully (copies empty string to clear clipboard)
- Special characters (quotes, brackets, unicode) handled correctly by piping through stdin
- `checkWlCopyAvailable()` helper to verify wl-copy is installed
- Integrated clipboard copy into `DaemonServer.handleStop()` - copies text after successful transcription
- Clipboard errors are logged but don't fail the transcription - text still available in lastTranscription
- Updated `formatResponse()` in client to show transcription text and "(Copied to clipboard)" message
- 13 new tests covering clipboard operations, error handling, and integration with wl-paste verification

### 2026-01-17: Step 6b - Auto-Type Output

- Created `src/output/typer.ts` with `typeText()` function using wtype subprocess
- Custom error classes: `WtypeNotFoundError` (with install instructions), `TyperError`
- wtype uses stdin mode with `-` argument to receive text to type
- Delay option supported with `-d` flag for milliseconds between keystrokes
- Empty text handled gracefully (returns immediately without starting wtype)
- Added `checkWtypeAvailable()` helper - wtype doesn't have --version, so we check via --help
- Added `OutputConfig` interface with `autoPaste` and `pasteMethod` fields
- Added `extractOutputConfig()` function to extract output settings from Config
- Integrated output handling into `DaemonServer.handleStop()` with new `handleOutput()` method
- Output flow: Always copy to clipboard first (as fallback), then try wtype if configured
- wtype failure falls back silently to clipboard - text is still available
- Config option `paste_method: "wtype" | "clipboard-only"` controls behavior
- 12 new tests covering typer module and error handling

### 2026-01-17: Step 7 - Notifications

- Created `src/notify/index.ts` with `sendNotification()` function using notify-send subprocess
- Custom error classes: `NotifySendNotFoundError` (with install instructions for Arch/Ubuntu/Fedora), `NotificationError`
- `NotificationOptions` interface supports: title, body, urgency (low/normal/critical), timeout, icon, appName
- Urgency maps directly to notify-send `--urgency` flag
- Timeout specified in milliseconds maps to `--expire-time`
- `checkNotifySendAvailable()` helper to verify notify-send is installed
- `Notifier` class wraps notification sending with config awareness:
  - Respects `enabled` config option - silently skips if disabled
  - Caches notify-send availability check - only checks once
  - All notification methods are best-effort - errors logged but not thrown
- Convenience methods on Notifier: `notifyRecordingStarted()`, `notifyTranscriptionComplete(text)`, `notifyError(message)`
- `notifyTranscriptionComplete()` truncates text preview to 100 chars with "..." suffix
- `extractNotificationConfig()` extracts notification config from app Config object
- Integrated notifications into `DaemonServer`:
  - Recording started notification sent in `handleStart()`
  - Transcription complete notification sent after successful transcription
  - Error notifications sent for: recording failures, transcription failures, clipboard failures, wtype failures
  - wtype failure notification includes "(text available in clipboard)" when clipboard succeeded
- Config schema already had `notifications.enabled` defined from earlier work
- 31 new tests covering notification module and Notifier class

### 2026-01-17: Step 8 - History Storage

- Created `src/history/index.ts` with history management functions and `HistoryManager` class
- History entries stored as timestamped text files in `~/.local/share/whispertui/history/`
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-mmm-nnn.txt` (timestamp + counter for uniqueness)
- Counter ensures unique filenames even when multiple saves occur in same millisecond
- `HistoryEntry` interface: id, timestamp (ISO 8601), text, path
- Functions: `saveHistory()`, `listHistory()`, `countHistory()`, `pruneHistory()`, `deleteHistory()`, `getHistory()`, `clearHistory()`
- `listHistory()` returns entries in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Supports limit and offset options for pagination
- `pruneHistory()` deletes oldest entries when exceeding max_entries
- `HistoryManager` class wraps functions with config awareness:
  - Respects `enabled` config option - returns null if disabled
  - Auto-prunes on save when exceeding maxEntries
- Integrated into `DaemonServer.handleStop()` - saves transcription after successful output
- CLI `history` command displays recent transcriptions with timestamps
- Supports `--limit N` and `-n N` flags to limit output
- `extractHistoryConfig()` extracts history settings from app Config
- 38 new tests covering all history functions and HistoryManager class
