# WhisperTUI Development Loop

## Context

You are implementing WhisperTUI - a terminal-based voice transcription tool for Linux/Wayland. This is a Bun/TypeScript project.

## Documentation

- Product spec: docs/product-spec.md
- Tech spec: docs/tech-spec.md
- Game plan: gameplan.md (stages, steps, acceptance criteria)
- Progress & learnings: progress.txt

## Your Task

1. Read `gameplan.md` to understand the stages and find the current task
2. Read `progress.txt` for context from previous iterations
3. Implement the next incomplete task
4. Verify all acceptance criteria for that task
5. Update `gameplan.md` to mark the task complete
6. Update `progress.txt` with any learnings or notes for the next iteration
7. Commit your changes

## Rules

- One task per iteration
- Always commit working code
- Update both gameplan.md and progress.txt before finishing
- Run tests before committing
